# React Questions

**1\. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?** <br/>
JSX is a way to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It makes creating React components easier and more readable.

**2\. What is the difference between props and state?** <br/>
Props are data passed from a parent component to a child component. State is data managed inside a component that can change over time.

**3\. What does the useState hook do, and where did you use it?** <br/>
useState is used to store and update changing data in React. I used it to store the selected technologies in the user's stack.

**4\. What does the useEffect hook do, and why did you need it?** <br/>
useEffect runs code after a component renders. It is commonly used for fetching data or other side effects. It can be used to load JSON data when the page starts.

**5\. Why does every item in a .map() list need a unique key?** <br/>
The key helps React identify each item and update the UI efficiently.

**6\. What is conditional rendering? Show one place you used it.** <br/>
Conditional rendering means showing different UI based on a condition.
Example: stack.length === 0? "Your Stack is empty": "Show selected technologies"

**7\. How do you pass data from parent to child, and child to parent?** <br/>
A parent passes data to a child using props. A child sends data back by calling a function received from the parent as a prop.
